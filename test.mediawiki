'''Puggle''' is an in-development external editor/parser for MediaWiki content. The motivation for this editor is to have an editor that "deeply" understands MediaWiki and can suggest fixes, and offer refactoring. It's a plugin for [[JetBrains|JetBrains']] [[IntelliJ]], there's a free "community edition" online, although any version of IntelliJ will work.

===Current Features===
* Syntax Highlighting
* Collapsing for references and templates
* Autocomplete Template names and parameters
* Autocomplete the insert of templates and possibly list optional fields (Suggested by [[User:CycloneIsaac|CycloneIsaac]])

===Current Issues===
* Some special characters will cease lexing

===In-Development Features===
* Enhanced table editing

===Desired Features===
* Template inspector (a bit like "Inspect element" in Google Chrome) where the tool would identify which template(s), LUA script(s) or css is responsible for a specific part of the template. (Suggested by [[User:とある白い猫|とある白い猫]])
